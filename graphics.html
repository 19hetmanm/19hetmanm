Evaluation of Web Pages:
<p>
<h2>The website I chose was Amazon.com</h2></p>
<br/><p><strong>A:</strong> The purpose of the graphics on the website I chose was to help give the readers/buyers an image of what they could buy or sell. On amazon, the images are mostly of products being sold, when you click on an item you like it brings you to a page just about that item. On the page are product descriptions and other facts like the price and who is selling it. There are also images provided to show you exactly what you could buy and also helps with what colors the product comes in.<br/><strong>B:</strong> The Amazon website meets the guidelines for effective use of web graphics pretty well. The graphics add color and fit well with the style page. One thing I was not able to have access to was the size of the image files, but the website itself loads fast. The graphics on the amazon website has a good contrast in using bright and dark images; this helps the reader focus on the important content. When the reader sees an image that catches their eye, then obviously the readersâ€™ eyes are going to go towards that information. The only text seen on the images are either the title of the book/movie are the brand/company of the product being sold. For those who have trouble seeing color, next to the images is the name, price, and seller of the product. If you click on the name of the product then it brings you to a page where more information is provided. Lastly, the contrast between the text and background color is good, you can easily read it. The background through the website is white and so as long as the text is not a light gray then any text color would be okay to read.

<h2 id="filetypes">Graphic File Types</h2>
<ul><strong>Image 1:</strong>The format the at would be best for putting Image 1 on a web page is SVG. Since Image 1 is a graph, SVG would be best because the graph may require to be displayed in multiple sizes depending on the device being used to view it.</ul>
<ul><strong>Image 2:</strong>The format the at would be best for putting Image 2 on a web page is JPEG. Image 2 is a picture of a monkey, JPEG is good for photography images that are still with complex colors. The colors in the monkey picture includes different shades of green, brown, gray, black, and white.</ul>
<ul><strong>Image 3:</strong>The format the at would be best for putting Image 3 on a web page is JPEG. Since Image 3 is an image of a mountain, JPEG would be good to use because it is a still image and complex colors. The colors in the mountain picture are blue, white, and pink but different shades of them. </ul>
<ul><strong>Image 4:</strong>The format the at would be best for putting Image 4 on a web page is PNG. Image 4 is a picture of four different colored puzzle pieces. PNG is used for color heavy and complex graphics. It is also good for image that might need to be re-exported or re-editing.</ul>
<ul><strong>Image 5:</strong>The format the at would be best for putting Image 5 on a web page is SVG. Image 5 shows a stop sign. SVG would work for this image because the stop sign could be displayed as a logo/icon with a strong, geometric design. The image also may need to be able to be displayed in different sizes depending on the device being used to view it.</ul>
