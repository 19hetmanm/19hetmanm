 <strong>Unit 2<br/></strong></h3>
<p>In Unit 2, I learned about HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is used to create documents on the web and includes a variety of tags that define the structure of the document. HTML allow documents to include headings, paragraphs, link, images, and other features. HTML contains container tags(bolded tag) and non-container tags(line break tag). I have used HTML to create my own web pages at home and at school. As well as HTML, I will be using CSS, the main difference between HTML and CSS is that HTML defines the structure and content of the document, and CSS controls the presentation.

<strong>Unit 3<br/></strong></h3>
<p> In Unit 3, I learned about CSS; this stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used in conjunction with HTML to control how web pages are displayed. With CSS there are two types of Value Property; Absolute Units and Relative Units. Absolute Units include; point(pt) and pixel(px). Relative Units include; percent(%) and em(em). Between Relative and Absolute, you would use Relative because they are scalable and hence preferable to use as compared to Absolute.

<strong>Unit 4<br/></strong></h3>
<p> In Unit 4, I learned about graphics and creating images like buttons and favicons for my website. First I learned about the different types of Copyright Laws and licenses like attribution, noncommercial, share-alike, creative common and public domain. Then I learned how to create a photo album on my webpage with 2 types of images(cropped and thumbnail). Lastly, I used Photoshop to create buttons for my website and a favicon for the address bar. While creating a button I used layering to make it easier to edit and view the different components of the button. The two buttons I made were for the photos and email, when you click on the email button it will take you to my school email.

<strong>Unit 5<br/></strong></h3>
<p> In Unit 5, I learned about the different between Client-side and Server-side scripting. Client-side scripts are executed within the user's web browser where Server-side scripts are executed on the web server before the web page is sent to the browser.  Client-side scripts can be read by the user and can be found in the source code of web pages that use them. Server-side scripts cannot be read by the user and can be found on the web server, and when requested by the web browser, they execute. The most common client-side scripting language is JavaScript, next is VBScript, most web developers use JavaScript because they are sure that their website will work in all browsers. The term progressive enhancement is used to describe the practice of creating web pages, first will CSS and then with JavaScript. In CSS you enhance the presentation and in JavaScript you enhance the functionality of the page. A database is any organized collection of information, it is used to store data. Next, I learned some JavaScript, like how to show an alert and create a clock.
</p>
<h3> Some Important Client and Server Scripts:</h3><ol>
<li>PHP(open-source script)-The most widely used scripting language on the web</li>
<li>Perl(open-source script)- Been around since 1987. Used extensively on websites that have been around a while.</li>
<li>ASP.NET(server-side scripting technology)-Developed by Microsoft and only runs on Microsoft servers. ASP stands for Active Server Pages and was used widely on the web. ASP.NET and ASP are different technologies.</li> 
<li>Java(object oriented)- Used to create software applications that run over the web.Released in 1995 and quickly because the hottest new programming language. Java and JavaScript are not related.</li>
<li>Python(open-source programming)- Designed to be easy to learn, simple, and easy to read. This would reduce the cost of program maintenance. Python is used by Google extensively. </li></ol>

<strong>Unit 6<br/></strong></h3>
<p>In Unit 6, I learned about quality control of a website. I learned how to validate a website using validators online. To check for accessibility and usability, I ran different tests to see what works and what I needed to change. 
</p>
<h3> Important Information </h3>
<ol><li>Make sure your website or CSS doesn't have borken link, bad grammar or misspelled words.</li>
<li>Usability is important because if a website is hard to use then people will leave. Usability helps to make sure that the site runs smooth and keeps people from leaving.</li></ol>

<strong>Unit 7<br/></strong></h3>
<p> In Unit 7, I learned about website management and authroing tools. The web authoring tool I used was Adobe Dreamweaver. Web authoring software comes with features like views(design, code, and split). Design view is the default view, it is a blank screen where you type, paste, or insernt content. Code view is where you can view and work directly with the HTML code. Lastly, split view is both the code and design views are displayed in separate windows.
