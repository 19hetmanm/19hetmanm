<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>The websites I studied were the Bordentown Middle School website, Yale Art website and TSA website. The target audience for the Middle School site would be student, parents, and staff. Art students would be the target for the Yale Art website and TSA members can competitors would be the target for the TSA website. For the Middle School site the task was to find an Algebra 1 teacher's contact information. For the Yale Art, the task was to find the contact information to apply to the summer program. The task for the TSA site was to find information about the 2014 and 2018 Conference.</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<ol>Subjects were able to complete the tasks for the Middle School and TSA website, the Yale Art site was too confusing and the task was not completed. It took 8 steps for the task for the Middle School page, 6 steps for the TSA task.</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<ol>I learned that the mroe organized the website is, the easier it will be for the user to navigate it. The current design for the Middle School and TSA website is effective because we were able to complete the task. The design for the Yale Art website si not because we were unable to complete the task. The Yale Art site needs to make the website more organized and simplier for the user to perform tasks.</ol>
